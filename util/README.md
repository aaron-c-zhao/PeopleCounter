## TESTING_HARNESS.CPP

Since the pipeline was supposed to be an module in an embedded system, it can not be executed by itself. This file is a harness that will run the pipeline on X86 platform.

## JSN.C

A third party library that used to parse json. This should not concern the pipeline in any means.
